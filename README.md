# Dispersion Model

This is an interactive network dispersion model used to test against wind tunnel experiments, simulations for a fixed set of receptors and source position and examine responses to changes in the street geometry. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To get started download the latest version of Matlab (or any version greater than version 6). Follow the instructions on the software installation here for MAC Os and here for Windows.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
